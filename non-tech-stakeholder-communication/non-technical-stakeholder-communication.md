# Role-Play: Explaining a Technical Issue to a Non-Technical Stakeholder

**Participants:**
- Non-Technical Stakeholder (NS): A stakeholder with limited technical knowledge.
- Technical Representative (TR): A technical expert responsible for explaining the issue.

**Scenario:**
NS: Hello, could you please update me on the progress of our project? I've heard there's a technical issue that needs addressing.

TR: Of course, let me provide you with an overview. We've encountered a technical issue related to the payment processing system on our Openfabric Testnet platform.

NS: Oh, I see. Can you explain the issue to me in more detail?

TR: Certainly. The issue revolves around the TestOFN token balance not being updated correctly after a user completes a purchase or creates a new instance of an AI application.

NS: TestOFN token balance? What does that mean exactly?

TR: TestOFN tokens are virtual tokens used within our platform for transactions, similar to virtual currency. Users use these tokens to pay for accessing AI applications or creating instances of those applications.

NS: I see. So, what's causing the problem with the balance not updating?

TR: It appears to be a technical glitch within the payment processing mechanism. When a user completes a transaction, the system fails to update the TestOFN token balance to reflect the deduction accurately.

NS: How does this affect our users and the platform?

TR: Well, users may experience confusion about their remaining token balance, leading to inaccuracies in financial transactions. This could potentially disrupt their usage of the platform and impact user satisfaction.

NS: That doesn't sound good. What steps are we taking to address this issue?

TR: We're currently investigating the root cause of the problem by reviewing the codebase and conducting thorough testing. Once we identify the cause, we'll implement necessary fixes to ensure the TestOFN token balance updates correctly after transactions.

NS: Thank you for the explanation. Please keep me updated on the progress of resolving this issue.

TR: Absolutely. We'll provide regular updates on our progress and ensure that the issue is resolved promptly.

**Conclusion:**
In this role-play, the Technical Representative effectively explained the technical issue regarding the TestOFN token balance not updating to the Non-Technical Stakeholder in a clear and understandable manner. The stakeholder gained insight into the issue and the steps being taken to address it.
